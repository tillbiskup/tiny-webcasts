 Tiny webcasts for lecture(r)s
###############################

Are you a lecturer and interested in not only providing your presentation slides online, but an **audio recording** as well? Would you like to have **small file sizes**, let's say 20--30 MB per hour recorded webcast? Would you be willing to accept a few restrictions, such as no mouse pointer and no HD audio quality? Than we might have something for you.


.. note::

   Interested in a real-world example? A (growing) :doc:`series of webcasts introducing "Tiny Webcasts" <examples>` created with -- well, you will guess it -- "Tiny Webcasts" is now available.
   

Features
########

  * Webcasts: slide shows with audio recording
  * Small file size: approx. 20--30 MB per hour (50--70 kbit/s)
  * Tool chain consisting exclusively of open source programs
  * Slides separated from audio: perfect for fixing typos, changing slide layout and alike
  * Open source, free of charge


In a nutshell
#############

To create webcasts, there is only a few simple steps:

  * Create your presentation (slide show) and convert it into PDF format
  * Record the audio for your presentation
  * Cut the audio trace in pieces, one file per slide
  * Run the scripts provided with this project
  * Upload and share your final webcast
