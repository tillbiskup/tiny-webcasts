"Tiny Webcasts" is a rather new project in its current form (started to be publicly available end of March 2020). However, it has been used by its principal author before, and is currently actively used by colleagues as well.

  "I highly recommend this tool. It is well documented and easy to use. I also used it for my first webcast and to be honest, I am not very good in programming. From my experience the biggest problem is the operator itself... talking to your microphone about your slides is a bit strange and takes some efforts in the first hours, but after some time you get used to it." *(a colleague and early adopter)*
