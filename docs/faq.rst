Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
################################

A (growing) list of questions users (and early adopters) of "Tiny Webcasts" asked and attempts to answer these questions.


How to install "Tiny Webcasts"?
===============================

Getting "Tiny Webcasts" to run is a two-step process:

  #. Download "Tiny Webcasts" from `GitHub <https://github.com/tillbiskup/tiny-webcasts>`_ and install it.
  
  #. Install all the :doc:`required programs <requirements>`.

Both steps are documented:

  * :doc:`Install "Tiny Webcasts" <installation>`
  
  * :doc:`Install the required programs <requirements>`.

Installation requires two things:

  * Internet connection (and a web browser)
  
  * A terminal (and basic knowledge how to use it)


Can I use "Tiny Webcasts" on Windows?
=====================================

Yes, you can (starting with release 0.2.0), thanks to adding functionality to create a docker image.


Why did you change the user interface?
======================================

Those users having used version 0.1.0 will notice that the user interface of the ``twc`` command has changed quite a bit with version 0.2.0. This is generally deemed bad practice, as the user interface should be as stable as possible, not having breaking changes (as in this case). However, there were good reasons for this change (usability), and there is a reason why we are still with version 0.x (see `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ for details).

The new user interface has been streamlined and should be much more convenient to use. The idea behind "Tiny Webcasts", besides small resulting videos, still is: **focus on your teaching, not the underlying technique**.
