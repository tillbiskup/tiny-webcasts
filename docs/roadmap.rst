Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the authors themselves:

  * Stable directory layout for webcasts
  
    * twc command for creating the directory layout
    
    * Safer handling of deleting/moving files
    
  * Converting WAV into FLAC (one-liner)
  
  * Configuration
  
    * General metadata for a series of webcasts
    
    * Format of video et cetera
    
  * Containerisation: docker
    
    * Web interface for convenient usage

  * Different formats
  
    * Opus video codec: https://opus-codec.org/
    
    * List of MP3 files with cover images
