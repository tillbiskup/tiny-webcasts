Who's the audience?
###################

Lecturers interested in providing audio recordings for their slides, but aware of limited resources and hence interested in small resulting file sizes.

If you want to record live webinars and want to have the speaker visible as small inset on the video, this is nothing for you.

If, however, you're interested in providing audio recordings to slides with minimal file sizes, hence allowing people even in remote areas and slow internet connection to access your material, this may be something for you.

An open mind for free and open-source software and the willingness to use command-line tools is as well quite helpful.
